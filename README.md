The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem essential for health and implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD, marked by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, is often associated with microbial dysbiosis (a disruption in the gut’s microbial balance). Understanding the relationships between specific bacterial taxa, microbial diversity, and clinical factors can reveal insights into disease mechanisms and potential biomarkers (Lloyd-Price et al., 2019).

This report addresses two research questions using datasets from a multi-omics study of IBD patients. The first question investigates whether the abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacteria is associated with IBD status. A univariate analysis is performed, with Ruminococcaceae abundance as the independent variable and IBD status as the dependent variable. The second question examines the association between bacterial diversity and Gender and consent_age, independent of IBD status, through multivariate analysis.

The datasets include genera.counts, containing bacterial abundance data, and metadata, with clinical and demographic information such as IBD status, Gender, and consent_age. Statistical testing and machine learning are applied to analyze the data. Machine learning models identify predictive microbial features for IBD, offering valuable insights into the microbiome’s role in disease and biomarker discovery.
